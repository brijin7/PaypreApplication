                                                <li>The abdominals are just like any other muscle group, for their definition to become visible, they must grow larger and the fat that lies over them must decrease. What makes the definition of the abdominals so difficult to see is that they are situated in the area of the body that contains the most fat.</li>

                                                <li>Strength training the abdominals is only half the story. My clients will get a flat stomach only when I combine strength training with cardiovascular exercise to get rid of the fat.</li>

                                                <li>Most clients do not do nearly enough cardiovascular exercise to decrease their body fat percentage to a point where they would see their abdominals.</li>

                                            The simple (and complex) answer is that there is no “best way” to lose fat. Each client will respond differently to a training program. However, there are some I apply when designing my clients’ programs.<br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Activities that incorporate many muscle groups and are weight bearing, they use more calories per minute and are therefore better suited for fat loss</li>
                                                <li>It is often assumed that low-intensity exercise is best for burning fat.</li>
                                                <li>To decrease body fat percentage, my clients do not necessarily have to use fat during exercise. Much of the fat from adipose is lost in the hours following exercise. Because clients can perform a greater intensity of work if the work is broken up with periods of rest, interval training is a great way to perform high-intensity work and help decrease body fat percentage.</li>
                                                <li>Both strength training and endurance exercise have been shown to decrease body fat percentage.</li>

The best and fastest way to achieve the “fitter and firmer” look women want is the same way that men achieve the “muscular” look they want: with weight training. And without it, a woman will never get much stronger.</li>

                                                <li>A muscle either gets stronger and more developed or it doesn’t. There’s no such thing as “toning” or gender-specific exercise; these are just the perceptions created by the fitness industry. I don’t think that’s a bad thing if it gets more women involved. What I’m saying is that if women squat, lunge, row, press, and deadlift, just like men, they’ll be rewarded with many times greater results than if they pursue some kind of dainty “toning” exercises with three-pound pink dumbbells or follow exercise programs that don’t use resistance at all.</li>

                                            It depends on the client’s goals. Many personal trainers think that performing strength training before cardiovascular exercise will augment the amount of fat used during the cardio workout because the strength training will deplete the muscles’ store of carbohydrates (glycogen).<br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>However, strength training is not likely to deplete glycogen stores, because a lot of the workout time is spent resting between sets and exercises. Even if the strength workout were long and intense enough to accomplish this task, exercising in a glycogen-depleted state has many negative consequences, including an increase in acidic compounds produced in response to low carbohydrate levels, low blood insulin, hypoglycemia, increased amino acid (protein) metabolism, increased blood and muscle ammonia and a strong perception of fatigue.</li>
                                                <li>Currently, no research shows that strength training immediately before a cardio workout increases the amount of fat used during the cardio workout, or vice versa. Most likely, the intensity of the activity, not the mode of exercise, determines the “fuel”—either fat, carbohydrate or protein—that is used.</li>

                                            After 2 – 3 weeks of sticking to your diet, you should assess how it’s going.<br>
                                            Weight loss isn’t the only criterion to consider when deciding if your diet is right or wrong. However, you should judge your progress based on the following criteria:<br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Your weight - did it go down, up, or stay the same?</li>
                                                <li>Your clothes - do they feel looser, tighter, or the same?</li>
                                                <li>The mirror - do you look thinner, fatter, or the same?</li>
                                                <br>
                                                <strong>Any of the above is up -> time to consult your dietian</strong>
                                                <br>
                                                <li>Your energy levels - do you feel energized, tired, or somewhere in between?</li>
                                                <li>Your strength - is it going up, down, or staying about the same?</li>
                                                <li>Your sleep - are you exhausted by the end of the night, do you have trouble</li>
